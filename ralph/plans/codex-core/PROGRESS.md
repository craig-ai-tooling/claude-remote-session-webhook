# Progress — Phase 1 — Codex core parity

Notebook for `ralph/plans/codex-core`. Each iteration appends below.

## Iteration 0 (planning, 10/6/26)

- Plan written from `specs/019-codex-runtime/`. No code changed.
- Measurements behind every Codex behaviour are in `specs/019-codex-runtime/research.md` section M.
- Left: every task in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, starting with T001.

## Iteration 1 (T001)

- Added `internal/harness` (`harness.go`, `harness_test.go`): `Name`, `Of`, `Label`, `Spec`, `For`, values per plan.md's table. Stdlib only.
- Tests written first and failed to compile (no package); after the implementation `go test ./internal/harness/...` passes. Full gate green (gofmt, build, vet, test, golangci-lint). No tmux or quickstart suite needed: nothing in tmuxctl, session or cmd changed.
- Nothing calls the package yet; T002 onward consume it.
- Left: T002 onward. No findings unfixed.
